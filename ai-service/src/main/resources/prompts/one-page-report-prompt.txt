     - Agriculture (crop recommendations based on soil & water availability)
     - Real estate (housing or commercial potential based on location)

   - Provide cost estimations and expected ROI for each suggested investment.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Summarize key insights.
   - Offer potential next steps for a detailed feasibility study.
